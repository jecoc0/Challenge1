# Challenge 1: 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor 

## Description:
The objective of Challenge 1 was to refactor existing code for a company called Horiseon with an emphasis on accessbilty and SEO optimization, overall, leaving the code better than how I found it.

### Some important steps I took for the client were:
1. Ensured all links functioned appropriately.
2. Optimized CSS by consolidating selectors and properties to eliminate redundancy.
3. Used appropriate semantic tags and structure in the HTML.
4. Added clarifying comments to explain each element of the HTML and CSS.


## Usage:
